# Ansgar + Lauren Wedding Website

When we were looking to build a web site we wanted to be able to build something that was more custom and our style than something a site builder like the Knot provided. When looking for a template to build off of we didn't find many open source wedding site projects.Based on that be found the following project: https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/ to work from. The github project can be found at https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-agency. We liked this project since it had already laid out several of the elements that we were looking for:
* Single page website
* Timeline
* Good fonts / format
* Team section

From this template several changes:
* Full screen landing image carousel
* Countdown timer to wedding
* New nav bar to be compatible with boot strap 3 carousel 
* Photo gallery making use of another carousel
* Rearranging / deleting / new sections to make it be a true wedding website.

## Things To Do

In an effort to get this done quickly for a single use and maintainability / scalability was not a concern the following were not done:
* Minification of CSS and JS that the Agency project had done was not use and removed from the project. 
* Some inline CSS was used.
